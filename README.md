usbSimCentral
=============

This is a half-finished project I started several years ago for a flight simulator panel. It is a windows program that uses the SimConnect SDK for Microsoft Flight Simulator X to drive USB instruments<sup>1</sup> using a DLL<sup>2</sup>. Micosoft Visual C# is required to compile.
